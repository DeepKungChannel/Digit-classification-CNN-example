# Deep Learning digit classification example app
## Install
First things first - you need to install the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) and [Keras](https://keras.io/installation/). or install the requirements.txt file.
<br/>
by using this command in your terminal
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
That's it!
<br/>

## Setup and run your app!!
It's very easy to setup.
<br/>
You can use our pretrained model or train your own model in my main.ipynb file.
<br/>
if you want to use our pretrained model, you can use the following command in your terminal to use the app.
```bash
python main.py
```

## How to use the app?
Just draw your digit on the canvas and click the button.
<br/>
That's it! - model will give you some prediction of your digit.
<br/>

## How to train your own model?
Train requires the following:
- 4GB of VRAM
- 2GB of RAM
- TURN OFF EVERYTHING THAT USE YOUR GPU

And run model.fit() in main.ipynb file
